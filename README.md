# Go Project Template

This is an opinionated Go project template you can use as a starting point for your project. It doesn't include any code generation, so you'll need to replace the placeholder variables/values/names with your own.

Clone the repository, keep what you need and delete everything else! Feel free to replace the parts that don't align with your use cases (e.g., you may prefer/use a different vendoring tool).

See [Go Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) for a more generic and a less opinionated starting point for your project.
